Additional Comments: In this paper we present a Bayesian framework for modeling uncertainty about a population's health state preferences. Such a framework is motivated by the need to analyze preference-based measurement data that arise from evaluation of health states by a sample of
individuals. The Bayesian framework leads to population utility estimation and health policy
evaluation by introducing a probabilistic interpretation of the multiattribute utility theory
(MAUT) models used in health economics. In so doing, our approach combines ideas from the
MAUT approach of Keeney and Raiffa [10] and Bayesian view point to provide an alternate
method of modeling preferences.

Musal, R., & Aktekin, T. (2015). Analysis of Income Inequality Measures on the HIV Mortality: a Bayesian Perspective. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society A. Published.

Additional Comments: Social, economic, environmental and behavioral factors impacting health, is well recognized
in the literature. In this paper, we consider the use of diﬀerent income inequality measures
in addition to a poverty measure and investigate their eﬀects on HIV mortality. In doing so,
we make use of models that are capable of capturing zero inﬂation and spatial dependence
typically observed in HIV mortality data. The research is motivated by the lack of studies from
an inference and modeling perspectives in estimating HIV mortality using measures that take into account socio-economic status as well as location. Such a study can help policy makers to identify cases of environmental injustice and areas of outstanding health risk to assist in resource allocation problems. In our numerical example, we make use of mortality data obtained for the
state of New York, estimate model parameters from a Bayesian inference perspective and discuss the implications/interpretations of diﬀerent income inequality measures.

Musal, R., & Soyer, R. (2014). Estimation of Group Priorities and Value of Information. Journal of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, (21), 173–181.

Additional Comments: In this paper we provide a methodology to quantify the amount
of information in a set of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) prior-
ity vectors involving a group decision making process. These vectors
represent the priorities of a group’s assigned weights to C objectives.
The quantification of the information content could be useful to decide
whether there is convergence of priorities assigned to these objectives
to a neighborhood, or the whether there is any value in obtaining addi-
tional samples in increasing the amount of information. We illustrate
the methods that we expose in this paper with an example from real-life
priority setting to an academic department’s objectives.

Fulton, L., Bastian, N., Mendez, F., & Musal, R. (2013). Rainwater harvesting system using a non-parametric stochastic rainfall generator. Simulation, 89(6), 693–702.

Additional Comments: With water becoming an even scarcer resource, rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are becoming increasingly more commonplace as mechanisms to capture and store rainwater for both agricultural and domestic use. Three important engineering considerations associated with the construction of RWH systems are the capture surface area, the tank volume
required for specific demand levels, and the number of expected occupants. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the engineering design of a RWH system in a semi-arid Texas region using a non-parametric stochastic rainfall generator
based on 64 years of data and to provide engineering charts and equations for future use. We model the RWH system using simulation techniques in order to estimate requirements for building a system capable of providing a family with 100% of its water requirements with demand never exceeding available supply

Additional Comments: In this paper, we investigate the effects of poverty and inequality on the number of HIV-related deaths in 62 New York counties via Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson models that exhibit spatial dependence. We quantify inequality via the Theil index and poverty via the ratios of two Census 2000 variables, the number of people under the poverty line and the number of people for whom poverty status is determined, in each Zip Code Tabulation Area. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of inequality and poverty in addition to spatial dependence between neighboring regions on HIV mortality rate, which can lead to improved health resource allocation decisions. In modeling county-specific HIV counts, we propose Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson models whose rates are functions of both covariate and spatial/random effects. To show how the proposed models work, we used three different publicly available data sets: TIGER Shapefiles, Census 2000, and mortality index files. In addition, we introduce parameter estimation issues of Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson models and discuss MCMC method implications. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Additional Comments: This manuscript discusses the common confusion between the terms probability and odds. To 
emphasize the importance and responsibility of being meticulous in the dissemination of 
information and knowledge, this manuscript reveals five cases of sources of inaccurate statistical 
language imbedded in the dissemination of information to the general public. The five cases 
presented are: Texas Lottery, Texas PowerBall, the Discovery Education Website, ScienceNews, 
and the Oregon State website.

Additional Comments: Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is a method used to measure the perceived physical and mental health of a population. This measure can be used for various purposes such as evaluating the severity of the effect of a
disease or comparing different treatment methods. There exist alternate
HRQoL measurements. In this paper we consider the Health Utility Index Mark II (HUI2) to quantify and describe a population's HRQoL over
health states which are composed of multiple attributes. We present a Bayesian framework for population utility estimation and health policy evaluation by introducing a probabilistic interpretation of the multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) used in health economics. In so doing, our approach combines ideas from the MAUT and Bayesian statistics and provides an alternative method of modeling preferences and utility estimation.

Additional Comments: We propose two models to identify fraud, waste and abuse in Medicare. These models are used to flag health care providers. The motivation for these models is based on observed cases of fraud. The paper details the use of clustering algorithms, regression analysis, and various descriptive statistics that are components of these models. Some of the challenges in the struggle to reduce fraud in Medicare are discussed.

Additional Comments: The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effect of computer-assisted (CA) certification standards on student performance in undergraduate statistics classes while controlling for locus of control, gender, age, and three measures of pre-existing ability. Fulton, Mangelsdorff, and Bewley (2009) demonstrated that in-class use of technology normally associated with distance learning improved student outcomes and satisfaction in statistics courses. Both of these works illustrated the efficacy of CA without specifically addressing content certification. Fulton, Ivanitskaya, and Erefeev (2010) confirmed that implementation of more frequent deadlines for content certification correlated with improved performance of graduate students in statistics classes after isolating students’ locus of control. Their study did not evaluate the efficacy of different certification standards (e.g., 70% versus 80% certification standards). This study addresses these shortcomings.

Additional Comments: In this two university, IRB-approved study of business statistics courses, we use Bayesian hierarchical modeling to search for the effects of pre-existing ability, demographics, manipulated homework certification standards, "cramming," and other covariates on the probability that a student achieves a particular grade. The significance of our research is that we are able to determine probabilistically the grade that students should expect given fixed covariate values. This information is valuable to both professors and students in realistically appraising likely performance. Our model is nonlinear in parameters and reflects a zero-inflated distribution, accounting for the population of students who did not have an economically rational reason to take the final examination. We identify the distinct number of student grade groups and employ mixed beta distributions in modeling the examination scores. By using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we are able to obtain the examination grade probability distribution that any student "i" will obtain given covariate values. As part of our research, we conduct cross-validation and evaluate model fit.

Feng, Li (Supporting), Chen, Xiao (Principal), Ekin, Tahir (Supporting), Musal, Rasim (Supporting). Enabling and Improving Data-Driven Research at Texas State University, National Science Foundation, Federal, $499,896.00. (Funded: October 1, 2014 - September 30, 2017). Grant.

Additional Comments: Data are now woven into every sector and function in our society. Texas State researchers are pioneering in solving some of the most pressing challenges using big data in the fields of Biochemistry, Biology, Geography, Computer Science, Finance and Economics, Mathematics, and Information Systems. Nonetheless, the current Texas State cyberinfrastructure and connectivity capacity present obstacles to the research projects involving big data and the collaborations among multiple institutions sharing massive amounts of data.

This project develops a high-speed campus network infrastructure to enable and improve data-driven research at Texas State. It enables immediate 10Gb capability and 100Gb in the future, and creates a Science DMZ on the campus network dedicated to research data to allow researchers to exchange large datasets with their peers over the network at a much faster speed. The infrastructure enhances and better facilitates big data research across a wide range of disciplines at Texas State with notable societal benefits, enables all other Texas State University System member institutions to establish similar environments to accommodate their research and education needs, advances the integration of research and education, promotes cross-institutional collaborations, and will significantly enhance the current big data research and teaching capabilities at Texas State and beyond.
