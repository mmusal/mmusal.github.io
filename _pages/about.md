I was born in Izmir, a coastal city in Turkey. Currently, I live in Texas, working on applied Bayesian models and teaching Data Mining/Statistical Modeling at Texas State University in San Marcos. I enjoy tackling complex problems, whether they're academic or in the realm of adventure. I have an affinity for the sea and mountains. Some of my favorite places to visit include Moab, Utah; Leadville, Buena Vista, Colorado; San Francisco; Bishop, California; Juneau, Talkeetna, Alaska; and Washington D.C.

My current focus is on merging Hidden Markov and Spatial Models using STAN. Working on this project taught me quite a few things and I would like to post about them and also communicate scientific results. I'm also working on optimizing computational processes for these models as they are computationally intense. Another area of interest for me is Fraud detection. Fraud detection is an interesting problem to tackle since it is involves unsupervised/semi supervised models.
