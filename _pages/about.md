I was born in Izmir, a coastal city in Turkey. Currently, I live in Texas, 
working on applied Bayesian models and teaching Data Mining/Statistical Modeling 
at Texas State University in San Marcos. I enjoy tackling complex problems, whether 
they're academic or in the realm of adventure. I have an affinity for the sea and 
mountains. Some of my favorite places to visit include Moab, Utah; 
Leadville, Buena Vista, Colorado; San Francisco; Bishop, California; 
Juneau, Talkeetna, Alaska; and Washington D.C. My current focus is on merging Hidden Markov 
and Spatial Models using STAN. I'm also working on optimizing computational processes. 
Another area of interest for me is Fraud detection.
