I was born in Izmir which is a coastal city in Turkey. Currently living in Texas working on applied Bayesian models and teaching Data Mining/ Statistical Modeling in Texas State University San Marcos. I enjoy working on hard to solve problems/projects whether they exist academically or in the adventure realm. I love the sea and the mountains. Favorite places to visit: Moab, Utah; Leadville, Buena Vista Colorado; San Francisco, Bishop; California, Juneau, Talkeetna Alaska, Washington D.C.. 
I have been working on combining Hidden Markov and Spatial Models using STAN. I am currently working on speeding the computational work. My other interest lies in Fraud detection.
