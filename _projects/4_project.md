In this project we would like to investigate the affect of socio-demographic and other variables on Covid-19 mortality in the counties of California. As we cab see from the application created by rshiny The questions we would like to answer are listed below:

# Project Questions
0. Can we represent the spatial dependence in the counties of California.

1. Among the available socio-demographic and other factors recorded for each county in California, which of them affected Covid-19 mortality.

2. To which extent were these socio-demographics and other factors affected the Covid-19 mortality counts.

3. How did these effects change through time (time is measured in biweeks).

4. Can we make models more robust by reducing the number of effects estimated per variable and tie it to policies. 

5. Can we represent different pandemic regimes in California and tie it to particular policies. 


To accomplish this we will need to discuss a set of concepts outlined [below](#set_of_concepts). 
We need to have an understanding of the scripting language R to represent the problem visually and prepare spatial neighborhood structures. We will
